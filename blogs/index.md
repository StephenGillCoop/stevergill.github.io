These are the blogs I follow. I use [feedly](http://www.feedly.com) which is an excellent tool saving me browsing to
each blog in turn to see if there is an update or not!

I plan to write some blog posts reviewing each blog I follow and the reasons why.

I've grouped the blogs into the subject areas that interest me, so some blogs will be listed more than once because they appear in more than one section.

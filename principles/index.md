Adhering to business principles is extremely important to me - so much so I'd turn down business unless its done the right way.

This section hopefully gives you an overview of how I like to work.

### Solving customer's problems
I believe you need to experience a problem to solve it - hence why a lot of solutions are made for by first business.

I also believe in order to build products that customers want, and you can run and support efficiently (without having
 to hire a massive team, eroding your profits) you either hire a really, really good solution architect who is prepared to completely understand the
concepts and technologies involved (for example, the advantage of using docker for a startup with limited skills to support
a complete unix stack), or you are that person!


### User experience
Talk about the user experience being so crucial. Lean startup is good, but having a product that becomes addictive and doesn't make
the user think is just as/more important to me.


### Niche markets
I believe in building solutions to niche markets - not trying to aim for the clouds with something I think everyone will use. solve a localised problem.


### Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS)
talk about early adoption of xero.

I love driving, ever since I got my driving license in 1993. 

#### 2001 330d
I've always been interested in BMWs, and got my first one in 2001, a steel blue 330d SE. I loved that car to bits.
I used to spent whole weekends polishing it, and its where I first started my love affair with [Zaino](https://www.zainostore.com) - IMHO the best sealant you can buy.

#### 2004 535d
Once the management buy out was complete in December 2004, I treated myself to a brand new 535d. From factory order to arrival at the dealer took just over 3 weeks - very impressive!

<talk about taking it on track, then to the Nurburgring etc>

#### 2006 C5L NO (M3 CSL)

After taking the 535d on track in Scotland and at the Nurburgring, the bug for track driving had well and truly stuck. The natural next stage was
to get a car dedicated to the track, and the dream car for the job was BMW's M3 CSL.

So in August 2006 I managed to find one in Edinburgh, and after a short test drive I collected it a few days later. That same day I was on my way to Germany with it!

I changed the plates to C5 LNO, which became C5L NO - "CSL Nordschleife" is what it stood for.

In May 2007 I had a small accident at the Nurburgring - the car only glanced the barrier, but because of the parts needing replaced the whole front of the car needed resprayed.

I used this opportunity to respray the whole car my favourite colour - white.

I took it back to the ring, to stay this time.

I sometimes took it to Papenburg, drifting.

After my crash in the 1 series (more on that below), I decided to start racing my CSL. I entered the CSL Cup.

After numerous problems with the SMG gearbox on the car, Tom Schirmer suggested we build a new car from scratch, using the old parts (like the engine) but with a new shell.

So C5L NO became no more - we stripped the car, and I sold the shell. Meanwhile Tom was rebuilding the engine, and creating an incredible race car (details below).

#### 2007 M5
The 535d due to its mileage was getting close to requiring replaced, and in February 2007 my local dealer had just got a nearly new M5 in stock. The fact I'd seen them at the Nurburgring numerous times, 
and that it had a beautiful V10 engine meant I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it, even though I only held onto it for a few months in the end.

#### 2007 320d Coupe
The M5 was getting very expensive on company car tax, and it wasn't as much fun as the M3 CSL, so it had to go. It had only lasted 3 months!

So in May 2007 I collected a brand new 320d Coupe. 

Because I am so into detailing cars, I asked the dealer to not prepare the car - in other words to leave all the packaging material and I would remove it myself, and give the car a proper detail (polish and wax)
before using it properly on the road. I think the neighbours thought I was mad!

The car was great - cheap on tax and automatic so was good in traffic. However, on one wet day in 2009 coming round a corner the car aquaplaned straight ahead into some bushes. That cost the insurance company
over Â£8,000 to repair, and I decided at that time to change again.

#### 2009 118d
This car literally saved my life! It inspired me to start racing my M3 CSL.

#### 2009 X6 3.5d
When I crashed the 118d, it was clearly a write off, so I jumped in my CSL (the only car I had to drive) and nervously made my way to the dealer. In stock was a lovely X6 3.5d, in black.

I fell in love straight away, and bought the car.

This picture was from when I loaned the car to a good friend of mine, Chris Slator, who was competing in the Help for Heros 4x4 rally across Europe, raising money for charity.

#### 2010 M3 CSL Team Schirmer Racecar GT012
Tom Schirmer runs Team Schirmer in Germany, very close to the Nurburgring. He is actually a licensed manufacturer, in the same way that Alpina is to BMWs. My racecar was his twelth production.

I still have this car today.

#### 2010 X6M
In 2010 I decided to trade in the X6 3.5d, and replace it with 2 cars; an X6M and a brand new M3. One was being built in the USA (the X6M) and the other in Germany (the M3) yet they ended
up arriving on the very same delivery truck at the dealer!

The X6M was beautiful - very high spec, and just wonderful to drive.

#### 2010 M3 (e92)

I unfortunately lost all my pictures of this car, but it looked identical to this one.

#### 2011 320d eD
As part of my move to Malta, I had to sell the X6M and M3. The import tax in Malta is very high, so I got a 320d efficient dynamics model, which was a lot cheaper to import.


#### 2015 X6M
After almost 4 years of 320d ownership, I had cravings for an X6 back in my life.

I did some research on the cheapest way to import one into Malta, and a high mileage 4 year old car was the answer.

I found a X6M in the right spec, and went to the UK to collect it.

My fiancee and I drove it back through Europe.

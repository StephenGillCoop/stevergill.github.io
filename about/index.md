I'm Steve Gill, 38 years old and I live in [Malta](https://www.google.com.mt/maps/place/Malta/@35.9440174,14.3795242,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x130e45281d8647c5:0xf582d86136be4239) with my fiancée and her 2 daughters. 
Even though I'm now resident in Malta, I love everything about the country I was born in, Scotland, especially the beautiful [highlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands) which is why I chose the picture above.

I've been involved in IT all of my life, and hopefully the chapters below will help you understand more about me.

### Edinburgh, Scotland
<img src="/images/edinburgh.jpg">

I was born in [Edinburgh, Scotland](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Edinburgh,+City+of+Edinburgh,+UK/@55.9410655,-3.2053836,12z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4887b800a5982623:0x64f2147b7ce71727)
 in 1976. Edinburgh is a beautiful city with plenty of green space, meaning most of
my childhood was spent outdoors.

### Commodore 16

<img src="/images/commodore16.png">

I'd been interested in computing from an early age, and during Christmas 1984, aged only 8 years, Santa was kind enough to
 get me a Commodore 16 (yes, 16k of RAM!). I can still remember the excitement of unwrapping the parcel, opening the box
 and taking out the computer inside, including the tape drive that sat alongside. I don't think anything since can
 come close to matching that initial excitement of my first computer, not even unboxing my iphones over the years!

My first experience of programming was when I wrote a GUI app for the Commodore 16 in BASIC. I tried my best to make it
look like the Apple Plus that was around at the time. It did look great until it ran out of memory
before you could actually do anything with it!

### Atari ST
<img src="/images/atarist.jpg">

In 1990 I saved up for an Atari 520STFM, which came with 512k of RAM. Within a month my first upgrade was to increase
the memory to 1MB. I can still clearly remember opening the parcel, installing the RAM chip and switching it on to see my
RAM had magically doubled.

I loved that Atari - it really sparked my interest in computers that remains with me to this day.

I remember once, when I was 16 and supposed to be studying for my school exams, my oldest brother came into my room and discovered me writing
a database of all my books, ISBN number, title, and author. I was super impressed with my work - him less so however, and he did suggest I'd
be wiser to spend my time studying for exams. This interest in databases and data accessibility has remained with me to this day, so I don't regret
it one bit!

<img src="/images/modem.jpg">

The Atari ST got me interested in the predecessor for home use Internet - [bulletin boards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system). My first modem was a 1200/75 baud - slightly slow by today's
standards!

I soon upgraded to a 2400 baud, before going straight to a 14,400 baud about a year later. I was quite a regular contributor in the Atari
bulletin board scene, and I enjoyed installing and setting up my own bulletin board system even though I didn't have a phone line to actually host it on.

My regular hang out was the STatic 2 BBS based in Edinburgh as well - I wonder whatever happened to that.
My friend [James](http://www.jamescoutts.co.uk/) and I met the owner once (Kevin Norman I think his name was?), to download shareware software directly from his hard disks to save time
downloading. Of course nowadays the idea of 2 young teenage boys going to a strangers house to copy stuff from his hard
disk would have a police SWAT team despatched to his address, but back in the late 80s and early 90s it wasn't such an issue!

### My First PC
<img src="/images/486dx33.jpg">

My first PC was a 486SX25. It was the highest processor I could afford - the entry level 486 chip.

The upgrade bug bit quickly though, and soon I'd upgraded to a 486DX33 chip, and not too long after that onto a 486DX266.
The upgradability of PCs had me hooked - after the processors, I was upgrading memory, graphics cards, sound cards - it was
an exciting world for a teenager interested in computers before the internet was generally available.

I still remember spending an afternoon loading Linux onto it, with 50(!) floppy disks!

One year later (1994), with thanks to the UK governments student loans facility, I splashed out on a new Pentium 90 - one
of the most modern PCs at the time. By now I was at my first year in university, and took advantage of the student prices for
Microsoft Office 4.3, which I installed onto Windows 3.11.

### Portobello High School

I went to [Portobello High School](http://portobellohighschool.org.uk/) in Edinburgh, from 1988 to 1994.

I left with 8 [Standard Grades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Grade), and 5 [Highers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_(Scottish)), and made a lot of good friends there.

### Standard Life
I did get a bit bored with education towards the end of my school years, so against advice I didn't intend to go to University. I wanted to start working as soon as possible, earn money and actually
do something productive. I joined [Standard Life](http://www.standardlife.com/), working in their unit trusts division for 3 months over Summer. I enjoyed it, but it became clear I was just a number in a large organization and career prospects
were limited. I wanted to make a difference, to produce something, whereas for most of my colleagues this was just a job and they couldn't wait to get out of the door at 5pm.

It really hit home when I was once in the printer room, collecting printouts to be sorted and distributed. Normally these printouts were taken off the printer by the IT department, ready for collection. This one time
however they were printed but still on the printer. Having experience of dot matrix printers (I had one at home!) I advanced the paper by one page, tore off the printed sheets and returned to my desk feeling smug. Bad move - 
it turns out that removing the paper from the printer was an IT department responsibility and I shouldn't have touched it. I got in trouble for that, even though it had saved the company time and allowed 5 other people to get on
with their work instead of twiddling their thumbs.

Needless to say I was frustrated by this.

### Napier University
So I decided to enroll into Computer Science at [Napier University](http://www.napier.ac.uk/). My friends and family were in Edinburgh and I really wanted to stay close to them.

I enjoyed a lot of the course but didn't enjoy the plagiarism amongst students that was rife at that time. To me, it made a mockery of the results because half of the work handed in
was copied from others. That, combined with the fact I didn't really enjoy education that much (I strongly wanted to be productive, and I felt in Education I wasn't being so), made me leave after 1 year and look
for a job in the subject I loved so much - IT.

Not just any job though - I had my heart set on working in a computer department of a large company. This was before Windows 95 came out -
most medium sized and above companies had specialist departments for everything IT related.

A friend recommended I go to the public library, and find something called the "Computer Users Yearbook".
I remember it well - there were 152 companies listed in Edinburgh with computer "departments", so I wrote the details of all 152 down,
went home and created a mail merge letter in Word 6.0 to all of them.

It basically said, "Please give me a job - as long as I work in IT I'll do anything".
I got 2 interviews, and one job offer - finally I was in IT and getting paid for it!

### Scotmid Co-op
Scotmid was the company I went to work for. In my interview I had my first experience of negotiation tactics, although I didn't realise it. 
I was hoping for a salary of around £8,000 - that's what I went into the meeting looking for. When the interviewer asked me how much I was hoping to earn, I froze
for just a few seconds - not deliberately I might add, I just froze for some reason. I almost blurted out, "£8,000!" but something held me back.

As the interviewer saw I was thinking, he jumped in. "How does £10,500 sound?".

I can't remember if I managed to keep a straight face or not. All I remember is immediately accepting his offer, and within a few days I'd joined Scotmid's IT team.

#### Data Operator
My first role was working with the team looking after the [ICL Series 39](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICL_Series_39) mainframe. This mainly involved running jobs, changing tapes and being
available to correct things if something went wrong. Interestingly the mainframe's operating system was called VME - a name that would become important in a few years!

#### IT Support Officer
I moved on from working with the mainframes to helping the department support the stores using their epos systems. This involved helpdesk work, as well as store visits to
assist with installations. I learnt a lot about epos systems from these days, because this was before the days of installers so you had to learn the nuts and bolts of how the 
systems hang together.

#### Access Developer
Because the workload for support wasn't particularly heavy, I got involved with side projects - mainly about solving business problems.
I used Microsoft Access databases, originally v2.0 then v6.0 to create solutions for various department's problems.

During this time I also worked closely with the internal IT manager, learning a lot about networking and Windows software.

#### Year 2000 Project
In 1998 I was given the task of being Scotmid's Year 2000 project manager. The most memorable project was actually the epos system. I had contacted
our existing epos supplier for a Y2K compliance statement, and while my boss was on holiday for 2 weeks the 
supplier came back to me advising our epos system was *not* Y2K compliant, and to make it compliant in time I would need to
authorise £156,000 expenditure by the end of the week!

I didn't have that kind of authority, and as my boss (the IT manager) was on holiday, I had to go to his boss, the depute CEO.
Thankfully Scotmid's management refused to be held to ransom and that supplier (who remains nameless!) was replaced within 18 months by VME Retail.

### VME Retail

#### Moving from Scotmid to VME
I was the project manager responsible for implementing the [VME Retail](http://www.vmeretail.com/) solution into all of Scotmid's stores, and in that role I
had a close working relationship with all the team at VME. My boss at Scotmid was almost 10 years away from retirement so my
career prospects within IT were limited, so I engaged with VME to see if there was a position in the business for me.

My 'transfer' from Scotmid to VME was on excellent terms - my boss completely understood and supported my move. His boss was very pragmatic about it, 
and only asked that I stay with Scotmid until the rollout of VME's solution had started - so basically the bulk of the work was out of the way. After agreeing
to join VME I remained with Scotmid for around 3 months to oversee the majority of the implementation project being completed.

#### General Manager
The role I understood I would be responsible for within VME was key accounts management, which was something I had skills in from my time
doing project management at Scotmid. However, Seamus Carey, the owner of VME, had recently had a heart bypass operation and as a result
the time he could dedicate to the business was limited. Within a few months I found myself promoted to General Manager of the entire business, leading
a management team. Being only 22 at the time, with no prior management experience, this was a [baptism of fire](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/baptism+of+fire)!

Over the next few years I learnt a lot about running a business, and I really enjoyed it even though it was very difficult at times. Seamus's core principle was the same as mine - that everything should revolve
around meeting the customer's needs. Happy customers are long term customers. We both used the phrase, "VME junkies", and by that we meant our job was to turn customers into
junkies - addicted to us. There was only one way to achieve this - satisfaction, and being able to use VME systems to grow and improve their own businesses.

#### Management Buy out
In 2003, Seamus decided now was the time for him to retire. We engaged with BDO Stoy Hayward to find a buyer for the business, with me continuing on to oversee the day to day management of the business.
Despite meeting various companies, none of the prospective acquirers excited Seamus (or I for that matter) because their sole interest seemed to be building VME up for a future sale, even if it meant
throwing our principles away and damaging relationships with our existing customers.

So after 1 year of this failed process, I sat down with the other 2 members of the management team and agreed with them to approach Seamus about a management buy out.

Seamus was excited by the idea - he got his money and chance to retire, and the business would continue with the principles he'd founded it with. It was a win/win situation if we could come to a deal. So I engaged
PWC in Belfast to represent myself and the rest of the management team, and BDO Stoy Hayward continued on representing Seamus.

The next 6 months were tough. We had to continue running the business, including negotiating large contracts with existing customers, as well as co-ordinate the management buy out. A pattern was to emerge quite quickly though - 
whenever Seamus and I sat down, just the 2 of us, we got things agreed quickly and fairly for both sides. Whenever the laywers were involved, things took weeks and often ended up upsetting people on both sides, needlessly. One meeting
in particular I'll remember for a long time. Seamus's laywer had not advised his bill until quite late in the process. Seamus expected the management team to cover it, so it was added to the agenda for our next meeting, being held
at PWC's offices in Belfast. As soon as we had sat down, regardless of the fact that PWC were chairing the meeting, this laywer stood up and said, "The first thing we need to sort out is my bill".

Everyone was taken aback at this - it was just plain rude and unprofessional. I immediately replied, "Your bill is a negotiation point like the other items ahead of it on the agenda". He then said, "OK then, I'm off" and started
 to pack up his things to leave. He thought I was suggesting that we were planning to negotiate the *amount* of his bill, which was incorrect. I was pointing out that who pays his bill is a point for negotiation, like the other points.
  As soon as he understood, he sat back down and the meeting continued, but the tone was set - he was increasingly aggressive with PWC's legal team who were representing us.
  
After about 3 hours of getting nowhere, I suggested that Seamus and I go to another room to talk through some points. When it was just the two of us, we came to an agreement within 10 minutes on all of the points that had taken
the legal teams 3 hours just to discuss without conclusion. When we returned to the main meeting, we both instructed our legal teams what we'd agreed, and the meeting was over only a few minutes later!

In December 2004, Seamus signed over the company to us. We were all very proud of the hard work as the entire deal was done without outside capital, so myself and the 2 other members of the management team
now owned 100% of the business.

#### Managing Director
Now the company belonged to the management team, the easy part was over - now we could lead the company in the direction we wanted to. The experience gained from being thrown in at the deep end at 22
became invaluable now, for I no longer had my mentor and friend Seamus Carey to fall back on for advice.

Over the next few years we transformed VME Retail into focusing on what it was extremely good at, and outsourcing the rest. 

We:
<ul>
<li>consolidated our three major offices in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland into 1 scottish office</li>
<li>outsourced hardware support and services so we could focus our time on producing the highest quality software</li>
<li>Massively improved communication both internally and with customers by using an online forum</li>
<li>Implemented working from home</li>
</ul>



### Tahoe Limited
Once I moved to Malta, I incorporated Tahoe Limited to facilitate expansion into markets outside of the UK.

Tahoe Limited owns Eposity, the cloud based epos system, as well as numerous other financial applications like Jobcostify and Cashflowify.

### Hillwalking
<img src="/images/647T0589.jpg">

Although I haven't been out in the hills for quite a few years, I used to love hillwalking in Scotland. Hills over 3000 feet in Scotland are called 'Munros', and there are 282 of them. I've climbed almost half, 
110 at last count.

### Photography
Started with a Sony F707, then a Canon D60, then 1Ds, then 1Ds Mk2, then 1Dx, then Sony FX1R(?)

#### Sony F707
My love affair with photography started with this great camera. Back in 2002, digital cameras were still being sold alongside film cameras. It was still reasonably new
 technology.

### Trading

Talk about trading, perhaps maybe talk about x years experience in the markets and volume?


### Driving
I love driving, ever since I got my driving license in 1993. 

#### 2001 330d
I've always been interested in BMWs, and got my first one in 2001, a steel blue 330d SE. I loved that car to bits.
I used to spent whole weekends polishing it, and its where I first started my love affair with [Zaino](https://www.zainostore.com) - IMHO the best sealant you can buy.

<img src="/images/DSC00669.jpg">

#### 2004 535d
Once the management buy out was complete in December 2004, I treated myself to a brand new 535d. From factory order to arrival at the dealer took just over 3 weeks - very impressive!

<img src="/images/IMG_0982.jpg">

<talk about taking it on track, then to the Nurburgring etc>

#### 2006 C5L NO (M3 CSL)

After taking the 535d on track in Scotland and at the Nurburgring, the bug for track driving had well and truly stuck. The natural next stage was
to get a car dedicated to the track, and the dream car for the job was BMW's M3 CSL.

So in August 2006 I managed to find one in Edinburgh, and after a short test drive I collected it a few days later. That same day I was on my way to Germany with it!

<img src="/images/IMG_1685_800.jpg">

I changed the plates to C5 LNO, which became C5L NO - "CSL Nordschleife" is what it stood for.

In May 2007 I had a small accident at the Nurburgring - the car only glanced the barrier, but because of the parts needing replaced the whole front of the car needed resprayed.

<img src="/images/IMG_2820.jpg">

I used this opportunity to respray the whole car my favourite colour - white.

<img src="/images/IMG_2903.jpg">

I took it back to the ring, to stay this time.

<img src="/images/NLP_3595-2.jpg">

I sometimes took it to Papenburg, drifting.

<img src="/images/PA9_1159R.jpg">

After my crash in the 1 series (more on that below), I decided to start racing my CSL. I entered the CSL Cup.

<img src="/images/whitecsl1.jpg">

After numerous problems with the SMG gearbox on the car, Tom Schirmer suggested we build a new car from scratch, using the old parts (like the engine) but with a new shell.

So C5L NO became no more - we stripped the car, and I sold the shell. Meanwhile Tom was rebuilding the engine, and creating an incredible race car (details below).

<img src="/images/1024_IMG_4459.jpg">

#### 2007 M5
The 535d due to its mileage was getting close to requiring replaced, and in February 2007 my local dealer had just got a nearly new M5 in stock. The fact I'd seen them at the Nurburgring numerous times, 
and that it had a beautiful V10 engine meant I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it, even though I only held onto it for a few months in the end.

<img src="/images/VQ5P0604.jpg">

#### 2007 320d Coupe
The M5 was getting very expensive on company car tax, and it wasn't as much fun as the M3 CSL, so it had to go. It had only lasted 3 months!

So in May 2007 I collected a brand new 320d Coupe. 

Because I am so into detailing cars, I asked the dealer to not prepare the car - in other words to leave all the packaging material and I would remove it myself, and give the car a proper detail (polish and wax)
before using it properly on the road. I think the neighbours thought I was mad!

<img src="/images/VQ5P0622.jpg">

The car was great - cheap on tax and automatic so was good in traffic. However, on one wet day in 2009 coming round a corner the car aquaplaned straight ahead into some bushes. That cost the insurance company
over £8,000 to repair, and I decided at that time to change again.

#### 2009 118d
This car literally saved my life! It inspired me to start racing my M3 CSL.

<img src="/images/1series.jpg">

<img src="/images/1series2.jpg">

#### 2009 X6 3.5d
When I crashed the 118d, it was clearly a write off, so I jumped in my CSL (the only car I had to drive) and nervously made my way to the dealer. In stock was a lovely X6 3.5d, in black.

I fell in love straight away, and bought the car.

<img src="/images/IMG_0459.jpg">

This picture was from when I loaned the car to a good friend of mine, Chris Slator, who was competing in the Help for Heros 4x4 rally across Europe, raising money for charity.

#### 2010 M3 CSL Team Schirmer Racecar GT012
Tom Schirmer runs Team Schirmer in Germany, very close to the Nurburgring. He is actually a licensed manufacturer, in the same way that Alpina is to BMWs. My racecar was his twelth production.

I still have this car today.

<img src="/images/IMG_4804.jpg">

<img src="/images/greycsl1.jpg">

<img src="/images/greycsl2.jpg">

#### 2010 X6M
In 2010 I decided to trade in the X6 3.5d, and replace it with 2 cars; an X6M and a brand new M3. One was being built in the USA (the X6M) and the other in Germany (the M3) yet they ended
up arriving on the very same delivery truck at the dealer!

The X6M was beautiful - very high spec, and just wonderful to drive.

<img src="/images/VQ5P4954.jpg">

#### 2010 M3 (e92)

I unfortunately lost all my pictures of this car, but it looked identical to this one.

<img src="/images/e92m31.jpg">

#### 2011 320d eD
As part of my move to Malta, I had to sell the X6M and M3. The import tax in Malta is very high, so I got a 320d efficient dynamics model, which was a lot cheaper to import.


#### 2015 X6M
After almost 4 years of 320d ownership, I had cravings for an X6 back in my life.

I did some research on the cheapest way to import one into Malta, and a high mileage 4 year old car was the answer.

I found a X6M in the right spec, and went to the UK to collect it.

My fiancee and I drove it back through Europe.

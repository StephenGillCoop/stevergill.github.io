### Edinburgh, Scotland
<img src="/images/edinburgh.jpg">

I was born in [Edinburgh, Scotland](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Edinburgh,+City+of+Edinburgh,+UK/@55.9410655,-3.2053836,12z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4887b800a5982623:0x64f2147b7ce71727)
 in 1976. Edinburgh is a beautiful city with plenty of green space, meaning most of
my childhood was spent outdoors.

### Commodore 16

<img src="/images/commodore16.png">

I'd been interested in computing from an early age, and during Christmas 1984, aged only 8 years, Santa was kind enough to
 get me a Commodore 16 (yes, 16k of RAM!). I can still remember the excitement of unwrapping the parcel, opening the box
 and taking out the computer inside, including the tape drive that sat alongside. I don't think anything since can
 come close to matching that initial excitement of my first computer, not even unboxing my iphones over the years!

My first experience of programming was when I wrote a GUI app for the Commodore 16 in BASIC. I tried my best to make it
look like the Apple Plus that was around at the time. It did look great until it ran out of memory
before you could actually do anything with it!

### Atari ST

In 1990 I saved up for an Atari 520STFM, which came with 512k of RAM. Within a month my first upgrade was to increase
the memory to 1MB. I can still clearly remember opening the parcel, installing the RAM chip and switching it on to see my
RAM had magically doubled.

I loved that Atari - it really sparked my interest in computers that remains with me to this day.

I remember once, when I was 16 and supposed to be studying for my school exams, my oldest brother came into my room and discovered me writing
a database of all my books, ISBN number, title, and author. I was super impressed with my work - him less so however, and he did suggest I'd
be wiser to spend my time studying for exams. This interest in databases and data accessibility has remained with me to this day, so I don't regret
it one bit!

The Atari ST got me interested in the predecessor for home use Internet - [bulletin boards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system). My first modem was a 1200/75 baud - slightly slow by today's
standards!

I soon upgraded to a 2400 baud, before going straight to a 14,400 baud about a year later. I was quite a regular contributor in the Atari
bulletin board scene, and I enjoyed installing and setting up my own bulletin board system even though I didn't have a phone line to actually host it on.

My regular hang out was the STatic 2 BBS based in Edinburgh as well - I wonder whatever happened to that.
My friend James and I met the owner once (Kevin Norman I think his name was?), to download shareware software directly from his hard disks to save time
downloading. Of course nowadays the idea of 2 young teenage boys going to a strangers house to copy stuff from his hard
disk would have a police SWAT team despatched to his address, but back in the late 80s and early 90s it wasn't such an issue!

### My First PC
<img src="/images/486dx33.jpg">

My first PC was a 486SX25. It was the highest processor I could afford - the entry level 486 chip.

The upgrade bug bit quickly though, and soon I'd upgraded to a 486DX33 chip, and not too long after that onto a 486DX266.
The upgradability of PCs had me hooked - after the processors, I was upgrading memory, graphics cards, sound cards - it was
an exciting world for a teenager interested in computers before the internet was generally available.

I still remember spending an afternoon loading Linux onto it, with 50(!) floppy disks!

One year later (1994), with thanks to the UK governments student loans facility, I splashed out on a new Pentium 90 - one
of the most modern PCs at the time. By now I was at my first year in university, and took advantage of the student prices for
Microsoft Office 4.3, which I installed onto Windows 3.11.

### Finding my first job

- school
- standard life
- uni for 1 year

After one year of studying Computer Science at Napier University I got bored of further education, so I decided to get a job.

Not just any job though - I had my heart set on working in a computer department of a large company. This was before Windows 95 came out -
most medium sized and above companies had specialist departments for everything IT related.

A friend recommended I go to the public library, and find something called the "Computer Users Yearbook".
I remember it well - there were 152 companies listed in Edinburgh with computer "departments", so I wrote the details of all 152 down,
went home and created a mail merge letter in Word 6.0 to all of them.

It basically said, "Please give me a job - as long as I work in IT I'll do anything".
I got 2 interviews, and one job offer - finally I was in IT and getting paid for it!

#### Scotmid Co-op, Edinburgh
I worked there for 4 years, learning a lot about mostly Windows and networking, but also solving business problems, mostly
using Microsoft Access databases, originally v2.0 then v6.0.

#### VME Retail


#### Tahoe Limited




### WIP

I believe you need to experience a problem to solve it - hence why a lot of solutions are made for by first business.


I also believe in order to build products that customers want, and you can run and support efficiently (without having
 to hire a massive team, eroding your profits) you either hire a really, really good solution architect who is prepared to completely understand the
concepts and technologies involved (for example, the advantage of using docker for a startup with limited skills to support
a complete unix stack), or you are that person!

Talk about the user experience being so crucial. Lean startup is good, but having a product that becomes addictive and doesn't make
the user think is just as/more important to me.

I believe in building solutions to niche markets - not trying to aim for the clouds with something I think everyone will use. solve a localised problem.

one bit talk about trading, perhaps maybe talk about x years experience in the markets and volume?

### Background

#### Edinburgh
Born and bred in Edinburgh, Scotland, I've been interested in computing from an early age - my first computer was a Commodore 16 (yes, 16k of RAM!). I wrote
a GUI app for it in BASIC that looked great until it ran out of memory! After that I saved up for an Atari ST, before finally
getting my first PC years later - a 486DX266. I still remember spending an afternoon loading Linux onto it, with 50(!) floppy disks!

insert story about being 16 and building a database to catalogue all my books (ISBN) instead of studying for my exams :)

#### School (Portobello High School)

I left school in 1994, 17 years old, and studied Computer Science at Napier University for 1 year before getting bored and deciding to find a job in IT.

#### University

Back in those days I had to go to the public library, and find something called the "Computer Users Yearbook, 1994 edition".
I remember it well - there were 152 companies listed in Edinburgh with computer "departments", so I wrote all 152 entries down,
and went home and created a mail merge letter in Word 6.0 to all of them. It basically said, "Please give me a job - as
long as I work in IT I'll do anything". I got 2 interviews, and one job offer - finally I was in IT and getting paid for it!

#### Scotmid Co-op
I worked there for 4 years, learning a lot about mostly Windows and networking, but also solving business problems, mostly
using Microsoft Access databases, originally v2.0 then v6.0.

#### VME Retail


#### Tahoe Limited




### WIP

I believe you need to experience a problem to solve it - hence why a lot of solutions are made for by first business.


I also believe in order to build products that customers want, and you can run and support efficiently (without having
 to hire a massive team, eroding your profits) you either hire a really, really good solution architect who is prepared to completely understand the
concepts and technologies involved (for example, the advantage of using docker for a startup with limited skills to support
a complete unix stack), or you are that person!

Talk about the user experience being so crucial. Lean startup is good, but having a product that becomes addictive and doesn't make
the user think is just as/more important to me.

I believe in building solutions to niche markets - not trying to aim for the clouds with something I think everyone will use. solve a localised problem.

split into headings

one bit talk about trading, perhaps maybe talk about x years experience in the markets and volume?

### Xero
This is a test.
